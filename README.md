# World Weather Analysis
## Overview of the project
Working to create a new travel app, PlanMyTrip, I have created a database using Application Programing Interface (API) to gather infromation from 2,000 cities around the world. In this modified and updated version of my original code, I have included weather description from the already existing weather data. In this app, users can input weather references in which the app will generate potential travel destinations by filtering the data based on the user's preference. Based on this information, the user will be able to create their own itinerary with directions and weather information. 
### Resources
- Google Maps Directions API
- Google Places API
- Python
## Results
PlanMyTrip app allows users to search for travel destinations based on weather preference. I've gathered data radomly from 2,000 cities/coordinates around the world. In the new weather data, I included weather description so that the users can read about current weather conditions. In the image below, you can see what this new DataFrame looks like, with the added feature.

With the user weather preference I was able to create a map of various travel destinations with Hotel Names, City, Country, and the current weather description. Below is an example of what the user might see.

After users pick a number of destinations they wish to travel too, the app will provide a map with travel routes for each destination. Check out the example itinerary below!

## Summary
The PlanMyTrip app is off to a great start, especially with the new upgrades. It is easy for users to search for potential travel destinations and gather weather information to make vacation plans. Also, the app can provide a detailed itinerary on how to travel to different locations. While the app has many great features, it can always improve. One upgrade that can be done is adding more filters based on user destination preference; not just weather. For instance, we can include a budget filter, type of vacation (e.g. beach, mountain, city, etc.), and perhaps a country preference. These filters can then be added to the info boxes on the map, giving a much more detailed description for a specific destination or marker. Regardless of improvements, the current state of the app is great and user friendly.
